# ML Project on HR Attrition Rate

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee departure data to identify factors influencing their decisions to leave the organization. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis techniques, we aim to develop predictive models for better workforce management.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Employee Departure Dataset**, which can be accessed via [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XoEt8xC_HCOxofrmFC0Mu_W2oHnfOt9z/view?usp=drive_link).

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Identify employees who are likely to leave the organization.
- Understand the factors influencing employee departures.

## Steps Followed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand trends, patterns, and outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Creation**: Build multiple machine learning models.
4. **Cross-Validation**: Validate models to ensure reliability and avoid overfitting.
5. **Pipeline Development**: Streamline the process from data preprocessing to model prediction.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Compare models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance by fine-tuning parameters.

## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and utilities.

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset and handle missing values.
- **EDA**: Generate insights through statistical summaries and visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhance data with new variables.
- **Model Building**: Develop and compare various machine learning models.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with validation metrics.
- **Tuning**: Improve model accuracy through hyperparameter optimization.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis step by step.

## Results
- Insights about factors affecting employee retention.
- Predictive models for identifying at-risk employees.

## Future Work
- Explore additional datasets for broader analysis.
- Deploy the model in a production environment.
